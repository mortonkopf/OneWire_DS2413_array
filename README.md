# OneWire_DS2413_array
An Arduino sketch that collects the addresses of all DS2413 devices on the string and puts the address info into an array

This is a simple sketch to show how to collect information on the connected devices. If using a small number of devices where you do not need to automate the location discovery, you can use this with a function that can use device addresses as string locations, and then associate switches, leds, etc, to a location number formed by the address location in the arrayfunciton.
